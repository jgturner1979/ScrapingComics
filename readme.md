MongoScrapper homework

So I didn't do very well with this homework.

I had several issues:

1. I could scrap the site the first time and populate the database with the results, however when you pushed the scrape button again, it didn't scrap the site and populate those results.

2. I got notes to save, but I couldn't get my delete button to work.

3. This assignment really frustrated me and made me realize that I'm not good at the backend server and database stuff.
